# Project 1 - Brewery Locator & Random Joke Generator

## Description

Using an API to locate breweries by city and another API to generate a random joke, we have created the Brewery Locator & Random Joke Generator application. Using two API's paired together for this application provides users with both a list of breweries in their area, as well as a random joke that they can use once they get there. 


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
